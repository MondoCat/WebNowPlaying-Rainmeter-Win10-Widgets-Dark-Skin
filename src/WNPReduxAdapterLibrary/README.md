This the source of WNPReduxAdapterLibrary.  
Including and merging the dll made Rainmeter's dllexporter mad, sooo.  
If this bothers you, don't worry, it bothers me too.

Current adapter library version: 2.0.1
Note: not really, it's the latest on github which is 2.0.1 with PositionPercent defaulting to 0 instead of 100
